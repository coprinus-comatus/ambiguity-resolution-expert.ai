    "How to resolve ambiguity for homographs and polysemy using expert.ai NLP technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity is one of the biggest challenges in NLP. When trying to understand the meaning of a word we consider several different aspects, such as the context in which it is used, our own knowledge of the world, and how a given word is generally used in society. Words change meaning over time and can also mean one thing in a certain domain and another in a different one. This phenomenon can be observed in homographs - two words that happen to be written in the same way, usually coming from different etymologies - and polysemy - one word that carries different meanings.<br/>\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll see how to resolve ambiguity in PoS tagging and semantic tagging, using expert.ai technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you start\n",
    "Please check how to install expert.ai NL API python SDK, either on this <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-what-docs-are-really-about-with-expert-ai-cd537e7a2798?showDomainSetup=true&gi=300077e01aa3'>Towards Data Science article</a> or on the official documentation, <a href='https://github.com/therealexpertai/nlapi-python#expertai-natural-language-api-for-python'>here</a>.\n",

    "## Part of Speech tagging\n",
    "Language is ambiguous: not only a sentence could be written in different ways and still convey the same v, but even lemmas - a concept that is supposed to be far less ambiguous - can carry different meanings. <br/>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "For example the word <i>play</i> could refer to to several different things. Let's take a look at the following examples:</br>\n",
    "<i>I really enjoyed the play.</i></br>\n",
    "<i>I'm in a band and I play the guitar.</i></br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Not only the same word can have different meanings, but it can be used in different roles: in the first sentence <i>play</i> is a noun, while in the second it's a verb. Assigning the correct grammatical label to each token is called PoS (Part of Speech) tagging and it's not a piece of cake.\n",
